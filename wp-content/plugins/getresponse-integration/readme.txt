The integration works smoothly with New GetResponse Forms that are tailored to your unique needs.

We created a one-stop-solution to make your online marketing easier and more efficient.

The Getresponse plug-in lets your WordPress visitors to subscribe via a sign up form, as well as via comment - all you need to do is add an invitation line that will be displayed in the comment form and their email address will be automatically added to your GetResponse campaign. Additionally, if you have a WooCommerce plugin installed at your e-store you can now add all the customers as they complete their orders - straight from the Checkout Page.
 
The plugin enables adding web forms created in GetResponse anywhere in your WordPress blog as well as inside your posts.

Once installed the plugin will activate a small drop-down menu inside the WP blog editor. It will include a list of all your GetResponse web forms.

GetResponse Integration plugin allows you to add web form on your blog by using the widgets. In the Widgets tab you can freely drag and drop the web form widget into the three areas of your blog: side bar, side bar next to the text and the footer area. Each web form can be displayed in the original GetResponse layout or the WordPress style. You can define the format by adding some small modifications in the web form HTML code string: “on” or “off”.
 
You can also enable subscriptions via the comments by switching the comments integration to ON. From this moment on, the comment box in your blog will include the checkbox to subscribe to your campaign when leaving a comment.

- Built-in integration with the following plugins:
	- WooCommerce
	- BuddyPress
